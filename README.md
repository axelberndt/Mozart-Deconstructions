### The Music
Create concert music using AI (artificial intelligence) that is at least 10 minutes long and relates to the [String Quintet in C major KV 515](https://dme.mozarteum.at/DME/nma/nma_cont.php?vsep=169&p1=27) by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. This was the task Axel Berndt was faced with in November 2022. The commissioner was the [Stuttgarter Kammerorchester](https://stuttgarter-kammerorchester.com) (Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra, SKO). The date set for the performance was May 10, 2023.

After some experimenting with the then current pretrained AI models, it was clear that there was no convincing one-click solution. Each technology has its own approach to musical (combinatorial) creativity and produces material that works better in one type of musical conception than in another. This is where the human composer comes into play, selecting the technology and integrating its outputs into a coherent musical form. 

It was also clear from the outset that no style copies would be generated. No AI has yet been able to completely convince in this discipline. Criticism and ridicule were guaranteed. Instead of letting AI compose like a human, it should compose like a human would not, thus becoming a creative tool that enriches human composing. With this principle in mind, the focus of work shifted away from technologies based on Deep Learning and towards technologies that enable more diverse and differentiated interaction. Thus, the control parameters of the technology could become a compositional domain. Markov models became a central technology in the pieces created here. 

In reference to the naming of the first computer-generated music, the *Illiac Suite* by Hiller and Isaacson, the pieces are also entitled “Experiments” here. Each experiment employs a different approach.
1. **Experiment Canon Crossover** begins with W. A. Mozart's instrumental canon *KV 562c Anh. Nr. 191* (smooth, melodious, long notes) and ends with J. S. Bach's instrumental canon *BWV 1073* (rhythmic, fast, short notes), two very contrasting canons. AI was tasked with generating a transitioning canon between the two. A Markov model was trained with both canons to generate possible canon beginnings. A combination of models from the *tonica fugata* suite was then used to execute the canon for four voices.
2. **Experiment Polyphonic Skeleton** ...
3. **Experiment Deconstruction -- Recombination -- Order** ...
